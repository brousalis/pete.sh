### **📝 Final Reminders**

2. **Deload:** Every 5th week, cut weights/sets by 50%.
3. **Elbow Check:** If you feel _any_ pain during an exercise, stop immediately and massage the
   forearm. Do not push through nerve/tendon pain.

### **☀️ The Morning Routine: "Oil the Hinge" (3-5 Minutes)**

_Do this right after you wake up. The goal is to open up your hips and upper back, which get stiff
from sleeping._

**1\. The Deep Squat Hold (1 Minute)**

- **Why:** Opens ankles, knees, and hips for the day. Essential for the "high step" moves in
  climbing.
- **Action:** Drop into the deepest squat you can. Keep heels flat. Use your elbows to push your
  knees out. Rock side to side gently.

**2\. Thoracic Openers / T-Spine Rotation (1 Minute)**

- **Why:** You are doing a lot of pulling (climbing) and carrying. This prevents you from developing
  a "hunchback" posture.
- Action: On hands and knees, put one hand behind your head. Rotate that elbow down to touch the
  opposite wrist, then rotate it all the way up to the ceiling. 30 seconds per side. Opens in a new
  window Getty Images 8 Yoga poses or asana posture for workout in Thoracic spine stretch concept.

**3\. Dead Hang (1 Minute)**

- **Why:** Decompresses your spine and wakes up your grip.
- **Action:** Just hang from a bar (or doorframe if sturdy). Let your back crack and pop.

### **🌙 The Night Routine: "Release the Brakes" (5 Minutes)**

_Do this 30 minutes before bed. The goal is to lengthen the muscles that tightened up during your
run or lift._

**1\. The "Couch Stretch" (2 Minutes)**

- **Why:** This is the \#1 stretch for you. Running and hiking tighten the hip flexors. Tight hip
  flexors cause lower back pain and "weak" glutes.
- **Action:** Kneel in front of a couch (or wall). Put one shin vertical against the couch cushion
  behind you. Squeeze your glute and stand tall. You should feel a massive pull in the front of your
  hip/thigh. 60 seconds per side.

**2\. Doorway Pec Stretch (1 Minute)**

- **Why:** Climbers and heavy lifters tend to roll their shoulders forward. This opens the chest so
  you can breathe better and stand taller.
- **Action:** Put your forearms against a doorframe at 90 degrees. Step through gently until you
  feel a stretch across your chest.

**3\. Child’s Pose with Side Reach (2 Minutes)**

- **Why:** Loosens the lats (from all the pull-ups) and the lower back (from the RDLs and hiking).
- Action: Kneel, sit back on your heels, and reach arms far forward on the floor. Then, walk both
  hands to the left (stretches right lat), hold, then walk to the right. Opens in a new window
