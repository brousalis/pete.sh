SECTION 2: THE GOLDEN RULES These rules apply to every single cup you make.

1. The "RDT" Spray is Mandatory Always spray your beans with one spritz of water before grinding in
   the Ode or S3. Shake the cup to coat them. This prevents static and mess.
2. Filter Hygiene Paper filters taste like cardboard. You must rinse every filter with hot water
   before adding coffee. Pour the rinse water out of the server/carafe before brewing.
3. Water Chemistry Routine A: Filtered tap water is fine. Routine B & C: Use distilled water with
   "Third Wave Water" mineral packets. This unlocks the "High Definition" fruit flavors.
4. The Bean Storage Rule Keep beans in their original bag, squeezed tight, in a cupboard. If you
   won't finish a bag within 3 weeks, tape it shut and freeze it. Thaw overnight before opening.

SECTION 3: STEP-BY-STEP ROUTINES ROUTINE A: THE MORNING BATCH (7:00 AM) Use this for a smooth,
sweet, large batch to start the day.

1. Prepare the Water Place the glass carafe on your scale and press "Tare" (Zero). Fill with cold
   water until the scale reads 1000g. Pour this into the machine reservoir.
2. Prepare the Filter Take a No. 4 Paper Filter. Fold the crimped seams (bottom and side) firmly to
   create a crease. Place in the basket and rinse with hot water. Dump the rinse water out of the
   carafe.
3. Machine Setup Set the basket switch to the Open Circle (Full Jug). Push the carafe firmly against
   the button at the base.
4. Grind (Ode Setting 9) Weigh 59g of beans. Spray (RDT). Grind on Ode Setting 9. Pour into the
   basket and shake to level.
5. The Brew (The Barista Stir) Turn the machine ON. Watch the water fill the basket. At the 0:45
   mark, use a spoon to gently stir the wet grounds (3 circles) to break up any dry crust.
6. Finish When the machine stops gurgling, remove the carafe, swirl it to mix the layers, and serve.
   Pro Tip: If you want to make the maximum 10 cups (1.25L), use 73.5g of coffee and coarsen the
   grind to Setting 10.

ROUTINE B: THE AFTERNOON CUP (2:00 PM) Use this for a solo, high-clarity coffee that emphasizes
fruit and sweetness. Uses the "Sweet Hybrid" Method.

1. Heat & Prep Set Kettle to 200°F. Place Hario Switch on the server. Insert Cafec Abaca filter.
   Rinse and dump the water. Important: Flip the Switch Lever DOWN (OPEN).
2. Grind (Timemore S3 Setting 7.5) Weigh 18.8g of beans. Spray (RDT). Grind on S3 Setting 7.5. Note:
   Hold the grinder at a 45-degree angle while grinding for a more consistent particle size.
3. Phase 1: The Flush (0:00 - 0:45) Place everything on the scale and Tare. Start Timer. Pour 60g of
   water vigorously and fast. Let it drain completely. Why: This washes away the sour fines and
   dust.
4. Phase 2: The Sugar Bath (0:45 - 2:30) Flip the Switch Lever UP (CLOSED). Pour remaining water
   until scale reads 300g total. The Swirl: Give the brewer one gentle swirl (3 seconds). DO NOT
   STIR. Let it steep undisturbed.
5. The Release (2:30) At 2:30, flip the Lever DOWN (OPEN). Let it drain. Swirl and enjoy.

ROUTINE C: THE SUNDAY THEATER (BRUNCH) Use this for manual brewing a large 1L batch for guests.

1. Heat & Prep Set Kettle to 212°F (Boiling). Rinse the Size 03 Filter heavily with hot water to
   pre-heat the glass server. Dump the water. Important: Lock the Switch Lever DOWN (OPEN).
2. Grind (Ode Setting 10) Weigh 62.5g of beans. Spray (RDT). Grind on Ode Setting 10 (Texture:
   Kosher Salt). Why: We grind coarse so the deep bed of coffee doesn't clog.
3. The Bloom (0:00) Start Timer. Pour 180g water. Use a spoon to dig to the bottom of the cone to
   ensure all grounds are wet.
4. The Pulse Pours At 0:45: Pour slow circles until scale reads 500g. At 1:45: Pour slow circles
   until scale reads 800g. At 2:30: Pour slow circles until scale reads 1000g.
5. Finish Allow it to drain (approx 4–5 mins total). Swirl and serve.

SECTION 4: CHICAGO BEAN GUIDE Match the beans to the grinder.

1. For Routine A & C (The Ode) Buy: Metric Coffee (West Fulton Market). Type: Single Origin Washed
   Process (Peru, Colombia, Honduras). Flavor: Clean, chocolate, citrus, structured.
2. For Routine B (The Timemore S3) Buy: Dark Matter or Dayglow. Type: Natural or Anaerobic Process
   (Ethiopia, Costa Rica). Flavor: Berry jam, wine, tropical fruit, funk. Shopping Strategy: Look
   for bags roasted 5 to 20 days ago. Do not buy beans older than 30 days.

SECTION 5: MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE Daily: Rinse servers and carafes with hot water. Weekly: Brush out
the burrs of the Timemore S3. Monthly: Dissolve a Cafiza tablet in the Moccamaster carafe and Hario
server. Let sit 20 mins to remove invisible oil buildup. Vacuum the chute of the Fellow Ode.
