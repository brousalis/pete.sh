### A. THE 7:00 AM "HOUSEHOLD SPLIT" (MOCCAMASTER)

1.  **Water:** Place Carafe on scale. Tare. Fill to **1000g**. Pour into reservoir.

    carafe.**
3.  **The Machine (Crucial):**

5.  **The Brew (The Barista Stir):** Turn on.
    - Watch the basket fill. At **0:45**, the grounds should be fully submerged.
    - **Stir** the slurry gently with a spoon (3 circles) to break up dry clumps.
6.  **Finish:** When the machine gurgles, remove carafe, **swirl**, and serve.

### B. THE 2:00 PM "GOD SWITCH" (HYBRID IMMERSION)

    heavy glass. **Dump water.**
2.  **Mode:** Lock Switch Lever **DOWN (OPEN)**.

6.  **Finish:** Give the brewer a gentle "Raft" swirl. Serve.

- **Water Chemistry (Third Wave):**
  - **Afternoon Cup:** ALWAYS use your Third Wave Water gallon. It provides the "high definition"
    flavor clarity.
  - **Morning Batch:** Optional. Using TWW prevents limescale buildup in the Moccamaster, but
    requires stocking distilled gallons.
- **The S3 Zero Point:** The S3 dial is external. Ensure "0" actually means the burrs are touching
  (closed).
- **No More Purging:** Keep the Ode on coarse (8-9) and the S3 on medium (6). No waste.
- **Heat Sink Management:** Rinse the Hario Switch 03 with hot water for 10s to pre-heat.
- **Static (RDT):** Spray beans with one spritz of water before grinding 62.5g in the Ode.

# THE STUDIO BEAN GUIDE

_How to buy software for your hardware._

## I. THE PHILOSOPHY: MATCH THE GRINDER

_You have two distinct flavor engines. Feed them what they like._

### 1. For the Fellow Ode Gen 2 (The "Daily Driver")

- **The Strength:** Flat Burrs = Extreme Clarity, Separation, "High Definition."
- **The Match:** **Washed Process Coffees.**
- **Why:** The Ode excels at taking a clean, structured bean and separating the flavors. A "Washed
  Ethiopia" or "Washed Colombia" will taste sparkling and juice-like.
- **Avoid:** Dark Roasts or Oily Beans. They will clog the Ode and taste like ash on flat burrs.

### 2. For the Timemore S3 (The "Wildcard")

- **The Strength:** Conical Burrs = Texture, Syrupy Body, Punchy Acidity.
- **The Match:** **Natural / Anaerobic / Honey Process.**
- **Why:** Natural processed beans (dried inside the fruit) are funky and jammy. The S3's conical
  burrs highlight that rich, thick body that the Ode sometimes strips away.

## II. THE CHICAGO SOURCE LIST

_You live in a world-class coffee city. Skip the shipping fees and go here._

### 1. Metric Coffee (West Fulton Market)

- **Best For:** Your **Morning Batch (Moccamaster)**.
- **Profile:** They are the "Clarity Kings" of Chicago. Ultra-clean, light-to-medium roasts.
- **Buy This:** Look for their **Single Origin Washed** coffees (Peru, Colombia, Honduras).
- **The Result:** It will taste like crystal-clear fruit juice.

### 2. Dark Matter Coffee (Ukrainian Village / West Town)

- **Best For:** Your **Afternoon Cup (Hario Switch / S3)**.
- **Profile:** Weird, loud, and funky. They specialize in barrel-aging, fermentation, and bold
  flavors.
- **Buy This:** Ask for a **Natural Process** or a **Barrel-Aged** bag.
- **The Result:** A heavy, winey, complex cup that thrives in the immersion mode of the Switch.

### 3. Dayglow (Kimball Arts Center / Logan Square)

- **Best For:** The **"Treat Yourself" Bag**.
- **Profile:** Dayglow is a multi-roaster shop that flies in the best beans from Europe (La Cabra,
  Tim Wendelboe, Dak).
- **Buy This:** Any bag that costs $25+.
- **The Result:** This is how you taste what they are drinking in Copenhagen or Tokyo.

### 4. Gaslight Coffee Roasters (Logan Square)

- **Best For:** The **Sunday Brunch**.
- **Profile:** Sweet, balanced, and crowd-pleasing without being boring.
- **Buy This:** Their seasonal house blends.
- **The Result:** Perfect for a 1-liter batch that everyone (even non-snobs) will love.

## III. HOW TO READ THE BAG (THE 3 RULES)

_Ignore the marketing fluff. Look for the data._

### 1. The Roast Date (The Golden Window)

- **Rule:** Never buy coffee without a date printed on it.
- **The Window:**
  - **0–5 Days:** **Too Fresh.** (Too much CO2 gas = sour/metallic brew).
  - **5–20 Days:** **Peak Flavor.** (Drink it now).
  - **30+ Days:** Fading. (Still good, but the "sparkle" is gone).

### 2. The Process

- **Washed:** Tastes like the seed. Clean, crisp, tea-like. _(Use the Ode)_.
- **Natural:** Tastes like the fruit. Berry, jam, wine, funk. _(Use the S3)_.
- **Honey:** A mix. Syrupy and sweet.

### 3. The Elevation (MASL)

- **Rule:** Look for **"1,600 masl"** (Meters Above Sea Level) or higher.
- **Why:** High elevation = slower growth = denser beans = more sugar and acidity.

## IV. YOUR SHOPPING STRATEGY

_Keep two bags in rotation at all times._

| Bag Type                | Grind With  | Profile Target                       | Routine       |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Bag A: The Daily**    | Ode Gen 2   | **Washed** (Central/South American)  | Morning Batch |
| **Bag B: The Wildcard** | Timemore S3 | **Natural** (Ethiopian/Experimental) | Afternoon Cup |

## V. STORAGE PROTOCOL

1. **The Airscape Rule:** If you buy a canister (like an Airscape), only put _one week's worth_ of
   beans in it.
2. **The Bag Rule:** Keep the rest in the original bag, squeezed tight, in a dark cupboard.
3. **The Freezer:** If you go out of town, tape the bag shut, put it in a Ziploc, and freeze it.
   **Thaw overnight** before opening.
