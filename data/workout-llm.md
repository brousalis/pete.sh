Context: User Profile & "Metabolic Breakthrough" Protocol (V9.0)

User Profile:

    Current Stats: Male, 5’11”, 205 lbs (Started at 230 lbs).

    Goal: Reach 185 lbs (-20 lbs). Physique goal is "Rock Climber" aesthetic: wire-strong, dense muscle, visible vascularity, zero bulk.

    Constraints: Trains at LA Fitness (Commercial Gym). Fasted training window (12:00 PM). Eating window (2:00 PM – 8:00 PM).

    Medical/Injury:

        Active Injury: Right Golfer's Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis). STRICT rehab protocol in place.

        Joints: History of shin/knee pain from running. Needs impact management.

Training Philosophy (V9.0):

    Strength: Low reps (3-6), heavy weight, stop 1 rep before failure. Focus on density (myofibrillar hypertrophy).

    Cardio: "Hybrid" approach (Run to deplete glycogen -> Incline Walk to burn fat).

    Shoe Strategy:

        Lifting Days (Mon/Tue/Fri): Zero Drop / Flat shoes (Stability).

        Cardio Days (Wed/Thu/Sat): Cushioned Running shoes (Shock Absorption).

The Weekly Schedule (V9.0)

    MONDAY (Strength - Elbow Safe):

        Focus: Neural Strength.

        Key Mods: Straight-Arm Pulldowns (No Pull-ups), DB Push Press, RDLs (with Straps), Reverse Lunges, Bear Hug Carry, Cable Pull-Throughs.

        Pre-hab: Rubber band finger extensions.

    TUESDAY (Core & Posture):

        Key Moves: Pallof Press, Ab Rollouts, Lying Leg Raises, Stomach Vacuums, Face Pulls.

    WEDNESDAY (Hybrid Fat Loss):

        Focus: Glycogen Depletion -> Fat Oxidation.

        Protocol: Run 2 Miles (Zone 2, 10:30 pace) → Immediately Hike 40 Mins (15% Incline, 3.0mph, Hands off rails).

        Pre-hab: Tibialis Raises.

    THURSDAY (Endurance - Plateau Breaker):

        Focus: Extra Caloric Burn.

        Protocol: Run 3–4 Miles (Zone 2 Slow). Stop if shins hurt.

    FRIDAY (Circuit - Shin Saver):

        Focus: Conditioning with low impact.

        Protocol: 4 Rounds, Zero Rest. TRX "Y" Flys + Push-ups + Chest Supported Row + Rower Sprint (Replaces Jump Rope).

    SATURDAY (HIIT):

        Focus: EPOC.

        Protocol: Sprints (30s @ 9.0mph / 90s Walk). 0-1% Incline only (Achilles safety).

    SUNDAY: Rest (10k Steps).

Key Rules for the AI:

    Monitor the Elbow: Do not suggest weighted pull-ups or heavy gripping until user confirms elbow is pain-free. Continue recommending finger extensions and forearm massage.

    No Bulk: Do not suggest hypertrophy ranges (3x10-12) for compound lifts. Stick to density ranges (2x5, 3x5).

    Salt Rule: User must take salt/electrolytes during fasted training to prevent bonking.

    Counter-Balance Rule: Once pull-ups resume, for every 1 lb bodyweight lost, add 1 lb to the dip belt.
