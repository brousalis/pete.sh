THE CHICAGO STUDIO COFFEE GUIDE (2026)
I. ROAST STRATEGY KEY

Apply these general rules to the specific recipes below.

    LIGHT ROAST (Metric, Washed)

        Goal: Acidity & Complexity.

        Temp: Boiling (212°F).

        Technique: High Agitation. Pour aggressively. Stir blooms. You want to force extraction.

        Ratio: Standard.

    MEDIUM ROAST (Dark Matter, Blends)

        Goal: Sweetness & Body.

        Temp: 200°F – 205°F.

        Technique: Gentle Agitation. Pour steadily. Minimal stirring.

        Ratio: Standard.

    DARK ROAST (Starbucks, Peet's)

        Goal: Light & Sweet (No Bitterness).

        Temp: 195°F (Manual) or Default (Machine).

        Technique: Zero Agitation. Do not stir. Let gravity do the work.

        Ratio: 1:18 (Use less coffee to reduce heaviness).

III. THE MOCCAMASTER (AUTO)

Range: 2 to 10 Cups (Max 1250ml)
2 Cups (600ml)

    Switch Setting: Half Jug (Pulse Flow).

Roast	Ratio	Coffee	Routine Notes
Light	1:17	35g	Stir at 0:30. Pulse flow is slow, so help it get wet.
Medium	1:17	35g	No Stir. Agitation here makes medium roast bitter.
Dark	1:18	33g	NO STIR. Use 1:18 ratio. Let the pulse flow handle it.
Standard Batch (8 Cups / 1 Liter)

    Switch Setting: Full Jug (Open Flow).

Roast	Ratio	Coffee	Routine Notes
Light	1:17	59g	Stir at 0:45. Break the crust thoroughly.
Medium	1:17	59g	Gentle Stir at 0:45. Just 3 circles to mix.
Dark	1:18	56g	NO STIR. Use 1:18 ratio. Stirring will cause clogging and ashiness.
