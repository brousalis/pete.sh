🛡️ The 5 Non-Negotiables (Read Every Day)
The Injury Protocol (Golfer's Elbow):
Status: ACTIVE. You must use the [ELBOW SAFE] exercises listed below. NO weighted pull-ups yet.
Rehab: Daily forearm massage (2 mins) + Finger Extensions (3 sets).
The "Salt" Rule:
Add 1/2 to 1 tsp of salt (or electrolyte packet) to your water. You are training for 2 hours fasted; without salt, you will bonk.
The "Metabolic Flush" Rule:
After lifting, you must keep your heart rate in Zone 2 (120-135 BPM) on the bike. Do not sprint. This is about burning pure fat, not building leg muscle.
11:30 AM: Collagen + Vit C (Tendon Repair).
12:00 PM - 2:00 PM (Workout): Water + 1 tsp Salt + Electrolytes.
2:00 PM (Meal 1): Curcumin (Inflammation) + Protein.
8:00 PM (Meal 2): Fish Oil (Joints).
