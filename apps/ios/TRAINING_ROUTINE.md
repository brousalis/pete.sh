🛡️ The 4 Non-Negotiables (Read First)

    The "Salt" Rule (Fasted Safety):

        Since you train fasted at 205 lbs, you must add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of salt (or an electrolyte packet) to your gym water. This prevents dizziness and keeps your veins popped.

    The "Counter-Balance" Rule (Day 1):

        Treat your Body Weight + Belt Weight as the total resistance.

        Example: If you lose 2 lbs next week, you must add 2 lbs to your pull-up belt. Do not let the exercise get easier.

    The "Shoe Strategy":

        Lifting Days (Mon, Tue, Fri): Wear Zero Drop / Flat Shoes (Vans, Converse) for stability.

        Cardio Days (Wed, Sat): Wear Cushioned Running Shoes to protect your joints.

    The Deload Week:

        Every 5th Week, cut all weights and sets by 50%. This prevents tendonitis.

# Superset information

The notation A1, A2 and B1, B2 refers to Supersets (or paired sets). This is a highly efficient way to train because it lets one muscle group rest while the opposing muscle group works.

Since you are at LA Fitness during low-traffic hours, you can claim two spots (or bring dumbbells to a pull-up bar) to make this happen.

Here is exactly how to execute the Monday workflow, step-by-step:
The "A" Block (The Heavy Upper Body Pair)

You alternate between Pulling (A1) and Pushing (A2).

    Do A1 (Weighted Pull-ups): Perform your 3–5 reps.

    Rest: Wait about 60–90 seconds. (Catch your breath, let your heart rate settle).

    Do A2 (DB Push Press): Perform your 4–6 reps.

    Rest: Wait 2 Minutes. (This longer rest is crucial so you are fresh for the next round of pull-ups).

    Repeat: Go back to A1. Do this cycle 3 times total.

    Done with A: Put the pull-up belt away and move to the next station.

The "B" Block (The Leg Power Pair)

You alternate between Hinging (B1) and Lunging (B2).

    Do B1 (Romanian Deadlift): Perform your 5–6 reps.

    Rest: Wait 60 seconds.

    Do B2 (DB Reverse Lunges): Perform 8–10 reps per leg.

    Rest: Wait 90 seconds.

    Repeat: Go back to B1. Do this cycle 3 times total.

The "C" Exercise (Grip Isolation)

This is a "Straight Set." You just do it by itself.

    Do C (Farmer's Carry): Walk until your grip fails.

    Rest: Wait 60–90 seconds.

    Repeat: Do this 3 times total.

The "D" Exercise (Metabolic Finisher)

This is also a "Straight Set."

    Do D (Cable Pull-Throughs): Perform 15–20 reps.

    Rest: Wait 60 seconds.

    Repeat: Do this 3 times total.

Summary of the Flow

    Warm-up

    A1 → Rest → A2 → Rest (x3 Rounds)

    B1 → Rest → B2 → Rest (x3 Rounds)

    C → Rest (x3 Rounds)

    D → Rest (x3 Rounds)

    Dead Hang (Cool Down)

Logistics Tip for LA Fitness: For the A1/A2 block, bring your Dumbbells over to the Pull-up station. That way, you don't have to walk across the gym between exercises, and no one will steal your equipment!
