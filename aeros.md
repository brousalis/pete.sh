Everything here is just a starting point for what we want to accomplish!

Objective: Build a high-conversion B2B brochure site targeting Hospital C-Suite Executives
Executive Summary
Aeros Consulting provides a comprehensive solution for hospitals to restructure their Sleep Apnea service lines. By integrating fragmented specialties (ENT, Pulmonary, Sleep Med) and incorporating disruptive therapies (GLP-1s, Neuromodulation), Aeros turns a cost center into a high-margin, high-volume profit center.

The Goal: The website must validate Aeros as the premier expert in this niche, moving a Hospital CEO/CFO from "Unaware" to "Requesting a Market Analysis." (Start the conversation)
Brand & Visual Strategy
Visual Direction
These are some generic notes for LLMs and other services on keywords to use when describing the Aeros brand.

Concept: "Structured Flow."
Imagery:
DO: Abstract networks, data visualization, architectural schematics, physicians collaborating in modern spaces, clean lines.
DON'T: Cliché stock photos of people sleeping, CPAP masks, bedrooms, or "drowsy" imagery.


Logo Design Brief:
Keywords: Breath, Elevation, Precision, Flow, Sleep, Clarity, Air
Style: Minimalist, Sans-serif typography, Abstract icon (representing airflow or interconnected nodes).

Go with this for now

We'll likely buy a couple and redirect to a single one to get better SEO/search with Google
Web & and Email Hosting

The best way to host/build the website is going to be via Webflow.com or Wix.com in my opinion. They host the sites, manage the domains, provide email domains, and better have drag and drop interfaces to update the copy, pages, etc - rather than me writing custom code.

We'll grab a template as a starting point, then incorporate all the things in this document. Some templates to consider.

FINALIZED WEBSITE COPY
======================

All copy below is ready to paste into the website template, organized page-by-page, section-by-section. The tone is authoritative yet approachable -- written for hospital CEOs and CFOs who are sophisticated buyers. No hype, no jargon soup, just clear value and clinical credibility.

Tone and voice notes (for consistency):
- DO: Use precise clinical and financial language. Speak peer-to-peer with executives. Acknowledge complexity honestly.
- DO: Use real clinical terms (GLP-1, neuromodulation, hypoglossal nerve stimulation) -- the audience knows them or will look them up. It signals credibility.
- DON'T: Use consulting cliches ("synergy," "leverage," "unlock," "disrupt" as a verb). Don't sound like a generic agency.
- DON'T: Oversell. The audience is skeptical of consultants by default. Let the specificity of the work do the selling.

--- FAQ SECTION ---

Section Headline:
Common questions from hospital leaders

Q: What makes sleep apnea a strategic priority right now?
A: Two forces are converging: CPAP adherence is declining (recent data shows sub-50% long-term compliance), and transformative new therapies -- GLP-1 medications, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, and combination surgical approaches -- are creating demand that most hospitals are not structured to meet. The institutions that build integrated programs first will capture referral networks and market share that are very difficult to displace.

Q: We already have a sleep lab. Why do we need Aeros?
A: A sleep lab is a diagnostic tool, not a service line. Most hospitals diagnose sleep apnea effectively but lose the patient at the treatment stage -- to outside CPAP vendors, uncoordinated specialists, or attrition. Aeros builds the clinical and administrative architecture that keeps patients in your system across the full continuum of care.

Q: How long does implementation typically take?
A: Most engagements show measurable clinical and financial results within 12 months. The initial assessment and algorithm design phase is typically 8-12 weeks, followed by phased specialty integration and a patient education rollout.

Q: What does the engagement model look like?
A: We begin with a Market Opportunity Audit -- a no-obligation assessment of your current sleep-related services, referral leakage, and revenue potential. From there, we propose a phased engagement tailored to your system's size, specialty mix, and strategic goals.

Title:
From Cost Center to Flagship: Rebuilding Sleep Apnea Care at a 350-Bed Community Hospital

Subtitle / Description:
How one Midwestern health system unified fragmented specialties, adopted emerging therapies, and turned an underperforming sleep lab into a $4.2M service line in 14 months.

Author: Aeros Consulting
Date: January 2026
Tag / Category: Case Study

--- HERO IMAGE ---

Replace the template image with a relevant image: physicians collaborating in a modern hospital setting, a data visualization, or architectural/clinical schematics per the brand guidelines. A placeholder is fine for now.


--- SECTION 1: "THE STARTING POINT" (replaces "Content with a Mission") ---

Every hospital has a sleep lab. Very few have a sleep program.

Midwestern Community Health (name anonymized) is a 350-bed community hospital serving a mixed urban-suburban population. Like most systems its size, it operated a six-bed sleep diagnostic lab and employed one sleep medicine physician. On paper, the lab existed. In practice, it was an island.

Patients were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and handed a CPAP prescription. From there, most were lost -- to outside DME vendors, to specialist referrals that never closed the loop, or simply to attrition. Pulmonology, ENT, and Primary Care each touched sleep patients, but none coordinated with the others. There was no shared algorithm, no unified intake pathway, and no mechanism to capture the downstream treatment revenue that sleep apnea generates.

The sleep lab was running at roughly 40% capacity. More than 60% of diagnosed patients had no documented follow-up within six months. Leadership had raised the question of whether to close the lab entirely.


--- SECTION 2: "THE TURNING POINT" (replaces "From Scroll to Action") ---

The hospital's VP of Clinical Operations had been tracking the emergence of GLP-1 therapies for OSA and the growing insurance coverage for hypoglossal nerve stimulation. She recognized that the treatment landscape was shifting -- and that her system was not positioned to benefit from it.

Aeros was engaged to conduct a Market Opportunity Audit: a structured assessment of the hospital's existing sleep-related departments, referral patterns, payor mix, and revenue leakage. The findings confirmed what leadership suspected -- but quantified it. The hospital was losing an estimated $3M+ annually in treatable sleep patients who left the system after diagnosis.

Rather than recommending new capital expenditure or facility expansion, Aeros proposed an integration-first strategy:

Phase 1 -- Care Algorithm Design. We developed a unified diagnostic and treatment pathway that incorporated CPAP, oral appliance therapy, GLP-1 medication referral, surgical evaluation (including neuromodulation candidacy), and weight management -- all triaged through a single intake process.

Phase 2 -- Specialty Integration. We facilitated structured collaboration between Pulmonology, ENT, Sleep Medicine, Bariatrics, and Primary Care. This was not a committee -- it was a defined workflow with shared EMR templates, cross-referral protocols, and monthly case review.

Phase 3 -- Patient Education & Engagement. We launched a patient-facing education program that explained the full range of treatment options beyond CPAP. This alone increased treatment initiation rates significantly, because patients who understand their options are far more likely to act.


--- TWO SIDE-BY-SIDE IMAGES ---

Replace template images with relevant visuals: a clinical team in discussion, and a chart or data visualization showing growth. Placeholders are fine for now.


--- SECTION 3: "THE RESULTS" (replaces "Value + Action = Impact") ---

Fourteen months after the start of the engagement, Midwestern Community Health reported the following:

- $4.2M in new annual sleep service line revenue, up from approximately $800K at baseline -- a 5x increase driven by retained patients, expanded treatment pathways, and improved coding capture.

- Sleep lab utilization increased from 40% to 92%, eliminating the conversation about closure.

- Patient retention through treatment completion improved to 78%, up from 34%. The single biggest driver was the unified intake pathway -- patients no longer fell through the cracks between departments.

- Three new specialist FTEs were hired (one ENT, one sleep medicine PA, one patient navigator), fully offset by program revenue within 8 months.

- Neuromodulation referrals -- previously zero -- reached 14 per quarter, establishing the hospital as a regional destination for Inspire therapy.

The program did not require new construction, major equipment purchases, or outside physician recruitment beyond the three hires. It was built almost entirely on restructuring what already existed.

Leadership approved a Phase 2 expansion to include pediatric sleep services and a community screening initiative before the first-year mark.

Clarifying Questions (still open)
----------------------------------
Data specifics: Do we have any specific numbers we can use anonymously? (e.g., "Increased service line revenue by 200% in 12 months" or "Managed 5,000+ patient lives"). Numbers sell to CFOs.

The Team: Do we have headshots and short bios for the key principals? Or should the "About Us" remain abstract/company-focused for now?

Geographic Scope: Is there a target audience/size for hospitals, a national US offering?

Competitors: Are there any other firms doing this specific integration? If so, who are they, so we can differentiate our visuals?

Background
The Problem
Sleep apnea is as common and morbid as diabetes and cardiac disease—and is comorbid with these and other major health challenges--but it is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to those illnesses. This deficiency is due to both historical and clinical structural factors. Large, integrated, and robust programs to promote and actuate many health service lines—structural heart, oncology, and neurointensive to name but a few--already exist in care delivery algorithms. Generally, we find none to manage sleep apnea. Sleep apnea care has historically been managed by CPAP, with the occasional patient benefitting from oral appliances, weight loss, or surgery. Even these limited interventions are managed by a diverse group of specialties—PCPs, sleep specialty, pulmonology, dentistry, bariatrics, ENT—who have vastly different skill sets and daily work queues. For these and other structural historical reasons, there is no natural cooperative relationship among these experts. The last two-to-five years have seen disruptive and transformative improvements in both medical and surgical sleep apnea care—GLPAs and neuromodulation, most prominently, but not exclusively—without any agreed-upon algorithm to incorporate them nor any integration among the even more fragmented specialty groups that can implement these interventions effectively. The disruption and transformation in sleep apnea care are poised to explode even further in the next few years with new medication platforms nearing FDA approval and new surgical interventions in advanced development. The ability to coordinate care effectively will become more rather than less challenging in the near foreseeable future.
The Opportunity
There are limited pre-existing entities capable of managing a multidisciplinary model to effectively implement an appropriate care algorithm. Hospitals and large multi-specialty organizations are uniquely positioned to effect a new paradigm of management. Any such entity that seizes that initiative stands to gain significant profit and establish market hegemony. These advantages are magnified by implementing this platform expeditiously. The downstream health benefit to any affected community is incalculable.
The Solution
Identify the unique needs of any given hospital system or multi-specialty group. Different entities will be addressing the relevant service lines at different levels of development and integration. There is broad variation in the demographic challenges and opportunities inherent in the process.
Develop and fine-tune robust and customized diagnostic processes to identify and engage with unmet needs.
Establish and refine a patient education platform.
Engage the relevant specialties with a framework of care and develop a bespoke algorithm that addresses their needs and abilities.
Establish the appropriate administrative oversight, coordination, and clinical/financial development pathways.
Create an iterative process for adding new therapeutic interventions and revising clinical, educational, and administrative algorithms.
Why Aeros?
We have done this before, generating exceptional profit for engaged institutions and making an enormous positive difference in the lives of thousands of patients. We have clinical, educational, and medical administrative professionals who have precisely this experience and the insights to adapt their practices to each unique healthcare organization. Our clinical experts have decades of experience in medical and surgical management of sleep treatment and critical care. They have worked in both employed and private practice models and with a wide range of socioeconomic and payor demographics. They understand how financial and workflow considerations influence the behavior of clinical professionals. They understand the history of the field and are actively engaged in both state-of-the-art interventions and the development pipeline for new breakthroughs. Our clinical educators have worked in sleep and critical care for many years and have had rich frontline experience in patient engagement and developing strategies for its improvement. Our health administrative professionals bring prolonged, broad, and deep experience in program development, day-to-day hospital and physician practice management, marketing, corporate oversight, and healthcare finance. We believe that sleep apnea care is an explosive clinical entity and a booming market opportunity, desperately in need of multidisciplinary coordination and oversight. We are passionate to bring demonstrated massive clinical benefit to a profoundly undertreated and enormous cohort of patients.
